            <h1> Frequent asked questions </h1>

            <h3> How do I post a free posting? </h3>
            <p> You can post a free ad without having an account or logging in to our site.  To learn how, please read our help page on how to create a free post. However, having a craigslist account will allow you to post, edit, delete, and repost more easily.</p>

             <h3> How can I edit my posting? </h3>
             <p> Edits for postings are now self-service. If you posted while logged in to your account, you can edit from your account homepage. Otherwise, use the link provided in the same self-posting email you used originally to self-post. If you can't find this, try having it re-sent. </p>
        
             <h3> How can I delete my posting? </h3>
             <p> If you posted using an account, you can delete your posting from your account homepage.  Otherwise, use the same link provided in the self-posting email that you used to post the ad originally. If you can't find this, try having it re-sent. Please note, all postings are automatically deleted upon expiration.</p>
            
             <h3> How often can I post? </h3>
             <p> You may post to one category and in one city, no more than once every 48 hours. If you try to post something similar to an active post of yours on the site, you may get a blocked message. Removing the similar active post should help, unless it is less than 48 hours old. </p>
            
             <h3> Can I add a picture to my posting? </h3>
            <p> In some categories, you will be offered the option to "Add Images" during the posting process. You will be prompted to upload images from your computer to craigslist.  </p>
